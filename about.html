			<h1 class="about">About</h1>

			<p class="aboutfirstparagraph">Graphic novels have delighted readers, both young and old, since the early 1900s. However, fun and light-hearted comics from the early years quickly turned to dark and gritty themes. Because of this, many Christian parents would forbid their children from reading comic books. Then family-friendly Christian media entered the main stream culture. However, is the childrens Christian media thatâ€™s being produced accruate to the gruesome tales that appear in the Old and New Testament?</p>
